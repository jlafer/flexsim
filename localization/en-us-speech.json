    "Hi John. I am having a problem with the device.",
    "Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. What seems to be the issue?",
    "Well. The battery life seems incredibly short. The thing is almost unusable.",
    "I see. How long does the battery last before it needs to be recharged?",
    "It only lasts about two hours and then I have to look for a charging station.",
    "How old is the device? If it's more than three years old, you probably need a new one.",
    "I don't want to upgrade but if that's the only solution then sign me up!",
    "Very good! I've placed and order for the latest version of the device. I'll send you a confirmation text.",
    "Thank you for your help. Good bye."
