# flexsim
This project is a Twilio Flex activity simulator.

It can generate a pseudo-random Flex configuration, deploy Flex infrastructure into a Twilio project, simulate a customer workload and the handling of the workload, thus simulating the activity one might expect to see in a customer environment. The activity can then be used for a few different purposes: demos of realtime dashboards; generation of data for Flex Insights demos; testing of TR workflows; testing of Flex plugins; and feeding semi-realistic events to EventStreams.

The system is composed of multiple, independent scripts: configuration generator, infrastructure deployer, customer simulator and agent simulator. There is also a cleanup script to remove in-process tasks and, optionally, the deployed simulator resources from a Flex project.

## genconfig
The configuration generator script reads a simulation domain description and produces configuration files as output. It is used at simulation design time and only needs to run when the domain description has changed. The domain description and/or configuration files can be checked into source control and shared among users. The script does not require a Twilio project to execute and the configuration files contain no Twilio SIDs that tie them to a specific project.

## deploy
The infrastructure deployment script reads the configuration files and executes against a specific Twilio Flex project. It is used at deployment time and only needs to run when the project is out of sync with the configuration files, such as if they have been regenerated by `genconfig` or edited manually.

Deployment consists of building Workers, TaskQueues and a Workflow. It does not touch any resources created outside of the `flexsim` configuration, so you can deploy into an existing Flex project without conflict.

NOTE: Care must be taken when other tasks are being routed in the project to ensure they are not handled by `flexsim` agents. Conversely, tasks generated by `flexsim` could be routed to your other Workers if the routing criteria overlap. This could be what you want if, for example, you want to login to Flex and handle tasks generated by the simulator.

## agentsim
The agent simulator script reads the configuration files, performs a login of the `flexsim` agents and makes them Available for work. When TaskRouter assigns them a Task, they "handle" it. The agents will also change their activity state occasionally, if so configured. It can run in any Flex project that has infrastructure in sync with the configuration files. It can run in the background during the presentation of a demo using that project.

## custsim
The customer simulator script reads the configuration files and generates Tasks that are then routed to the simulation agents by the TaskRouter workflow deployed previously. The configuration files control the arrive rate, channels, customer intents and other parameters. Most behaviors are semi-random, meaning they have targets but can vary in a pseudo-random fashion around their target.

## Configuration
The system has four execution modes: configuration generation, infrastructure deployment, simulation and (as needed) cleanup. The configuration generation mode uses a combination of localized default values and user-supplied inputs to generate a set of JSON configuration files. The deployment, simulation and cleanup modules then read the configuration files when executing against a Flex project.

### Defaults
For ease of use, the configuration generator can be run without any input from the user, simply by relying on default domain values. This will support a bare-bones, generic simulation environment. The default values have been chosen to support a typical SE-led customer demo. They are not very realistic but they do make for a lively demo in the Flex realtime dashboards. Thus, the defaults may not be appropriate for other use cases.

The defaults have been localized for US English and are read (by default) from a file at `localization/en-us.json`. The `flexsim` system can be localized for a different locale by creation of a different defaults file, which can then be specified using the `--locale` option to the `genconfig` script.

The default values can then be overridden by the user using a combination of a `domain.json` file and command-line options. The `genconfig` script uses the combination of those values to generate the configuration files used during the other modes of operation.

### domain.json
For saving a custom simulation domain description, the user can provision a file, named `domain.json`. The `genconfig` script can read this file and generate configuration files based on the description there.  This allows the user to control nearly every aspect of the resulting simulation: tasks, channels, agent counts, customer intents, routing criteria, handle times, agent activities, etc.

The format of the file is not yet documented in this README. However, you can inspect the `src/helpers/schema.js` file to see a JSON Schema definition for the file. You can also inspect the `domain.json` file in the `domain` folder for an example. These two should get the early adopter started. :-)

### Domain Schema
The localization files and optional `domain.json` file must adhere to the same specific schema. TO BE DOCUMENTED

The domain description consists of an object with a set of specific property keys. One the keys is `props`, which is a (sub-)object describing a series of configurable properties. There is a set of standard properties that must be present for the simulation to run correctly. All of the standard properties are supplied by the localization file. The user can also specify and configure their own custom properties. The primary use of custom properties is to generate values for Worker and Task attributes.

The standard properties that must be present include the following:

#### arrivalGap
This is the mean time between new inbound tasks arriving from customers.

#### channel
This is the set of task channels that can be used by customer tasks. Every configured value must be present in the target Twilio project.

#### abandonTime
This is the mean time before customers will abandon their task if not yet accepted by an agent.

#### waitTime
This is the actual time that the task waited before being accepted by an agent. It has a custom calculation and can not be configured by the user but this prop must be present in the localization file. It can be used to influence the value of other properties (e.g., customer satisfaction metrics).

#### talkTime
This is the mean "talk" time for tasks once accepted by an agent.

#### wrapTime
This is the mean "wrapping" time for tasks once accepted by an agent.

#### activity
This is the set of worker activity codes that can be used by the agents. Every configured value must be present in the target Twilio project.

### Command-line Options
Each `flexsim` script supports a set of command-line options, which can be used to make dynamic changes to its operation. Most of these relate to Flex credentials, file locations, task volumes, agent counts and other quantitative aspects of the simulation.
 
### Environment Variables
The scripts that use a Twilio project can use the following environment variables to reference that project and Workspace:
- ACCOUNT_SID
- AUTH_TOKEN
- WRKSPC_SID

The `genconfig` and simulation scripts accept a variable to set a seed value for the random number generator.
- RANDOM_SEED

The `agentsim` script also accepts a variable to specify the HTTP listening port.
- AGENTSIM_PORT

A `.env` file placed in the project root folder can be used to supply those variables to all scripts. See `.env.sample` for a template.

### Preparing a Flex Project for flexsim

#### Task Channels
If you specify any non-standard channels in your domain, make sure the corresponding TaskChannels have been created in the target Flex project prior to running `custsim`. 

#### Worker Activities
If you specify any non-standard Worker activities in your domain, make sure they have been created in the target Flex project prior to running `agentsim`.

#### Skills
To avoid conflicts with the existing configuration of your target Flex project, the `deploy` script doesn't build out the list of possible `routing.skills` values nor the proficiencies. Thus, you should use the Flex Admin page, under the Skills menu choice, to define any of the skills that can be assigned to agents. By default these are: "Sales", "Service" and "Support".

## Localization
The simulator supports localization. Default values for domain data are read from a localized file, which can be specified using the `--locale` option when running `genconfig`. Currently, the only default domain-values file supplied is for US English. The project maintainers are looking for assistance in creating default domain-values files for other locales.

When a locale is specified, `genconfig` will generate localized agent names and `custsim` will generate localized customer names. Currently, the supported locales for naming people include: 'en_us', 'es_sp', 'de_de' and 'fr_fr'.

## Script Execution
In the project directory, there are five NodeJS scripts. See the `execution.txt` file in the project root directory for sample command lines to run these scripts.

### genconfig
To start the `genconfig` script:
```
node ./src/genconfig [--domaindir dir] [--cfgdir dir] [--locale code] [--seed abcde]
```
The optional command-line options include:
- `domaindir` specifies the directory where the `domain.json` file, if any, is located
- `cfgdir` specifies the directory where the configuration files should be written
- `locale` specifies the name of a locale, which is a 5-letter language and country code (following the ISO 639-1 and ISO 3166-1 standards, e.g., 'es_sp').
- `seed` sets a seed value for the random number generator for predictable results

### deploy
To start the `deploy` script:
```
node ./src/deploy [--cfgdir dir] [--acct ACxxx] [--auth abcde] [--wrkspc WSxxxx] [--assignURL url]
```
The optional command-line options include:
- `cfgdir` specifies the directory where the configuration files to be read are located
- `assignURL` specifies the ssignment callback URL to be written into the generated Workflow; this should refer to the `agentsim` host and listening port

- Authentication credentials can also be supplied via the command line, overriding any found in the environment.


### agentsim
`agentsim` is an Express server that handles tasks in a specific Twilio project and TR workspace.

Currently, `agentsim` must be started and the agents should be signed-in before `custsim`.

It supports a single URL path:
- `/reservation` is called by the TR assignment callback to request acceptance of the task by a specific agent. The script uses this request to trigger simulated handling of each task.

To start the `agentsim` script:
```
node ./src/agentsim [--cfgdir dir] [--acct ACxxx] [--auth abcde] [--wrkspc WSxxxx] [--port num] [--seed abcde]
```
The optional command-line options include:
- `cfgdir` specifies the directory where the configuration files to be read are located
- `port` specifies the HTTP port on which the program listens for callbacks from TaskRouter; if not specified here or in the environment, the default is 3000
- `seed` sets a seed value for the random number generator for predictable results

- Authentication credentials can also be supplied via the command line, overriding any found in the environment.

#### agentsim must be publicly accessible
The simulation builds and deploys a TR Workflow that uses the configured Task attributes, routing criteria and Worker attributes to select and reserve the `flexsim` agents. When a reservation is made, Twilio calls the Workflow-specified assignment callback URL, in order to let the `agentsim` program know that an agent has been assigned a task and that it should now start "handling" the task. That URL can be configured by the user and must reference the host and port of the `agentsim` script, which must be publicly accessible. On a development machine, this can be done using a tunnel service like `ngrok`.

### custsim
To start the `custsim` script:
```
node ./src/custsim [--cfgdir dir] [--acct ACxxx] [--auth abcde] [--wrkspc WSxxxx] [--timeLim num] [--locale code] [--seed abcde]
```
The optional command-line options include:
- `cfgdir` specifies the directory where the configuration files to be read are located
- `locale` specifies the name of a locale, which is a 5-letter language and country code (following the ISO 639-1 and ISO 3166-1 standards, e.g., 'es_sp').
- `seed` sets a seed value for the random number generator for predictable results

- Authentication credentials can also be supplied via the command line, overriding any found in the environment.


### cleansim
To start the `cleansim` script:
```
node ./src/cleansim [--cfgdir dir] [--acct ACxxx] [--auth abcde] [--wrkspc WSxxxx]
```
The optional command-line options include:
- `cfgdir` specifies the directory where the configuration files to be read are located

- Authentication credentials can also be supplied via the command line, overriding any found in the environment.

## Using flexsim in a Demo
When using `flexsim` in a demo, here are some tips:
- All simulated agents start out in an Available state and it takes awhile for the random nature of the simulation to place agents in a mixture of activities that is both realistic and in line with the configured value-percentages. Thus, start `agentsim` at least 10 minutes before your demo.

## Known Limitations
- The project has not yet reached a "1.0" status and there will be breaking changes from time to time.
- The building of test cases has only just started. Please report any bugs and every atttempt will be made to get it resolved quickly.
- The tasks generated by `custsim` are real TaskRouter tasks but they are not linked to any media (e.g., voice or text). Thus, the user can't click on a task in the TeamsView, for example, and expect to listen to an active call or see a chat transcript. This capability is under consideration.
- Only inbound tasks are currently supported.
- Only `uniform` and `bell` distributions are currently  supported for `range` values. The `log`arithmic distribution is not yet supported.
- Only `shift` effects can be used with bell-curve property values. The `skew` parameter is not yet supported.
